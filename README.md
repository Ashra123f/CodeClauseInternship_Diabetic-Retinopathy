# Diabetic-Retinopathy
People with diabetes experience diabetic retinopathy, which, if left untreated, can result in permanent blindness. Using SVM and KNN algorithms, we provide a new and effective way to diagnose retinopathy using retinal fundus images. The goal of this issue is to create a system that could assist ophthalmologists in identifying blindness before it occurs.  Diabetic retinopathy, the primary cause of blindness in working-age adults, affects millions of individuals. Aravind Eye Hospital in India wants to find and stop this condition among rural residents where it is difficult to do medical screening. To identify the DR level in a person's retinal images, APTOS (Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society Symposium) has provided eye fundus images under a range of imaging circumstances with labels.
